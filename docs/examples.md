## Common Patterns
We have several example applications that demonstrate the use of the DGS framework in a fully working example.
Each example has detailed documentation in the corresponding Github repository, and is further explained in code comments.

* [Java DGS example](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-examples-java): An implementation of a typical GraphQL service
* [Kotlin DGS example](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-examples-kotlin): The same example as above, but implemented in Kotlin
* [Federation examples](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-federation-example): A Federated GraphQL example, using Apollo Gateway


## Community Contributions
We welcome contributions from the community. Check out some of these examples for more patterns.

* [Authorization using custom directives](https://github.com/ankit-joinwal/netflix-dgs-authorisation-directives): Authz using a custom @secured directive
