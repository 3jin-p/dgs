We have several example applications that demonstrate the use of the DGS framework in a fully working example.
Each example has detailed documentation in the corresponding Github repository, and is further explained in code comments.

* [Java DGS example](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-examples-java): An implementation of a typical GraphQL service 
* [Kotlin DGS example](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-examples-kotlin): The same example as above, but implemented in Kotlin
* [Federation examples](https://github.com/Netflix/dgs-federation-example): A Federated GraphQL example, using Apollo Gateway
