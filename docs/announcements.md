### Upcoming Release of the DGS Framework for Spring Boot 3.0 (January 10, 2024)
We plan to release a new version 6.x of the DGS Framework supporting Spring Boot 3.0 by end of January 2023. 
There are no known additional changes required to use the new version of the DGs framework.
We will continue to maintain a separate release train for the DGS framework (5.x.x) on Spring Boot 2.7 till the end of 2023.
Only patches and minor features will be available on the Spring Boot 2.7 compatible releases.
